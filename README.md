A FUNNY STORY
One morning I was on my way to school and I was in a hurry when suddenly a bird shit on my jacket. So I whent back home to change my clothes. Because of that I eventually got late to school. When I told my story to my teacher she didn't believe me and I got to write 2 pages as a punishment since that day I hate birds.
